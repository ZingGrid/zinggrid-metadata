# ZingGrid Metadata

This repository contains the content model schema, capabilities metadata and feature registry for ZingGrid.

The content model schema defines the allowed parent–child relationships between elements, specifying which elements may contain or be nested within others.

The capabilities metadata defines the configuration contract for each component, including required and disallowed attributes.

The feature registry defines the set of available features and, for each feature, documents related, analogous, and alternative features.

> Note: This repository does **not** include the ZingGrid library itself. Install `zinggrid` via npm to use the components.


## Installation

Install the main ZingGrid library:

```bash
npm install zinggrid
```
